# Test Design: *MP-006*

## Test Design Inputs

### Requirements

MPP-02 Pet Store allows to find an existing information about a pet

## Test Procedure

### Test Setup

```gherkin
Given Autotest Framework is launched
And pet server base URI: "https://petstore.swagger.io/v2" is set
And new pet with random name (length from 3 to 7 symbols included, only Latin letters)
and random <status>  is created
And new pet is added to server via Post http method (endpoint "/pet", body)
And added pet id is returned
```

|status|
|-----------------------------|
|"available", "pending", "sold"|

### Test Scenarios

#### Scenario Positive:
**MP-006-1** Verify pet information can be found by pet id
```gherkin
Given initial setup
When Autotest Framework gets pet via Get http method (endpoint "/pet/" + id, id
in path) from server
Then server returns pet information
And  Autotest Framework compares information about created in precondition pet and
returned pet by id from precondition. Assert they're equal
```

### Test Clean Up
Given test scenario is completed
When Autotest Framework deletes added pet via Delete http method, endpoint "/pet/" + id,
api_key in header "special-key"
Then pet is deleted
