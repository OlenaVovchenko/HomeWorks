# Test Design: *MP-007*

## Test Design Inputs

### Requirements

MPP-03 Pet Store allows to update the information about existing pet

## Test Procedure

### Test Setup

```gherkin
Given Autotest Framework is launched
And pet server base URI: "https://petstore.swagger.io/v2" is set
And new pet with random pet name (length from 3 to 7 symbols included, only Latin letters)
and random <status>  is created
And new pet is added to server via Post http method (endpoint "/pet", body)
And added pet id is returned
And new random pet name (length from 3 to 7 symbols included, only Latin letters) and status are created
```

|status|
|-----------------------------|
|"available", "pending", "sold"|

### Test Scenarios

#### Scenario Positive:
**MP-007-1** Verify pet name and status can be updated
```gherkin
Given initial setup
When Autotest Framework updates pet name and status via Post http method (endpoint "/pet") with form data at server
And Autotest Framework gets pet via Get http method (endpoint "/pet/" + id) from server
Then server returns updated pet information: new name and new status
And Autotest Framework compares new name with pet name from server. Assert they're equal
And Autotest Framework compares new status with pet status from server. Assert they're equal
```

### Test Clean Up
```gherkin
Given test scenario is completed
When Autotest Framework deletes added pet via Delete http method, endpoint "/pet/" + id,
api_key in header "special-key"
Then pet  is deleted
```
